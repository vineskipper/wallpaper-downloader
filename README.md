# Wallpaper Downloader (WIP)
## Description
A simple program that downloads, and stores files from links in a text file.
## Origin
I had the idea when I was getting new wallpapers, because:

>1. After a while it became annoying to download, rename, and then choose the directory to store the files in; and
>2. I couldn't download all the files at the time I was viewing them, and I wanted a way to remember the files so I could download them at the later time.

I ended up just storing the image links in a text file, and, because I didn't want to have to look at each image again to come up with descriptive names for them, wrote down their names in the text file.

Later when I wanted to download the files, I realized could've just solved all the problems listed above by creating this program.
