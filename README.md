# Wallpaper Downloader (WIP)
## Description
A simple program that downloads, and stores files from links in a text file.
## Origin
I had the idea when I was getting new wallpapers, because:

>1. After a while it became annoying to download, rename, and then choose the directory to store the files in; and
>2. I couldn't download all the files at the time I was viewing them, and I wanted a way to remember the files so I could download them at the later time.

I ended up just storing the image links in a text file, and, because I didn't want to have to look at each image again to come up with descriptive names for them, wrote down their names in the text file.

Later when I wanted to download the files, I realized could've just solved all the problems listed above by creating this program.

## Format Guide
(WIP)

## Upcoming Features (WIP)
### Automatic formating for directory and file names
This will include snakecase, camelcase, automatic file naming, and file extension addition to file names. This be set by the user when running the program.
### Interactive mode
This will run the program with a TUI that includes image displays, file and directory name changing, and a chance to manually select which files to download.
### Silent mode
This will run the program without displaying any errors that were encountered during runtime. It will instead store any error found in a log file for later use.
